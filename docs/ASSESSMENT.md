Assessment
==========

Write an extended essay with the title: “Explain the patterns of and controls on the spatial and temporal characteristics of terrestrial carbon fluxes and stocks in recent decades”

Length and core requirements
----------------------------

Your essay should be 3500 words or less (not including figure captions and references).

It should directly address the essay title and synthesise materials from reading around the subject of terrestrial carbon dynamics: modelling and monitoring, and well as course practicals and seminar materials.

It should demonstrate an understanding of core underlying theories, models and appropriate measurement methods and be able to express them simply and clearly.

Topic area
-----------

The essay should provide an in-depth analysis of the current state of knowledge on the topic. It should be a synthesis of information from multiple papers that you have read, and not simply a regurgitation of course notes and figures. It should not simply be a re-hash of sections of IPCC synthesis reports.

It should ideally use concepts from the main aspects of the course: basic theory, models, and measurement, and the integration of models and measurement.

Essay style
-----------

The essay should have a clear structure, and be based around material from multiple (>10) sources. It should be a synthesis, and not simply be a list of information from a set of different papers.

It should be based around the same focus as the course, i.e. terrestrial vegetation, rather than soils or atmospheric processes, although you may wish to touch upon such matters for context.

You must work individually on your submission. When using practical- and seminar-related items, these must be materials you have generated yourself (e.g. you can’t use a graph that another student has generated: you must use your own).

As for all coursework of this nature, to get a very high mark, you will be expected to show clear insight into the subject matter and make use of materials beyond the basics provided in the lectures.

Figures, citations and quotes You must follow standard UCL procedures on citations, and fully attribute all materials used.

All figures and any quotes must be correctly captioned, giving the original source of any graphics used. Any quotes should have a page number associated with them, BUT you should not be using large numbers of direct quotes or long quotes in an essay of this nature, rather synthesising information and phrasing it in your own words. This does NOT mean simply changing a few words around.

Avoid citations of material as ‘geog0133 coursenotes’ and strictly avoid any quotation or figures from the course notes themselves.

You may develop your own figures, but make clear what they are based on (or where the information comes from).

The essay must be fully referenced. For reference to individual figures are other specific information from long or complex sources, make sure you include as page number.
