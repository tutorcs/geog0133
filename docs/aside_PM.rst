Exercise: Penman-Monteith equation
------------------------------------


The Penman-Monteith equation allows evapotranspiration to be calculated from meteorological data.

The FAO provide a `set of guidelines on how evapotranspiration can be calculated for a crop <http://www.fao.org/docrep/X0490E/x0490e05.htm#TopOfPage>`_. 

Use one or more of the examples in this document to code (in python) and test a model of evapotranspiration.

Once you have coded your model, you might explore the impact of some of the assumed parameters on the evapotranspiration.
